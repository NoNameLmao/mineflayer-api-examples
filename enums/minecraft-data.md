# minecraft-data

Access it using two methods:
- Using the [minecraft-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-data) package,
which is installed with mineflayer automatically.
```js
const mcdata = require('minecraft-data')('<any version from 1.0.0 to 22w14a>');
```

- (RECOMMENDED) Using [bot.registry](https://github.com/NoNameLmao/mineflayer-api-examples/blob/main/bot/registry.md) after creating a mineflayer bot
```js
const mcdata = bot.registry;
```
