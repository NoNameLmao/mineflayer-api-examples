# minecraft-data

Access it by using the [minecraft-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minecraft-data) package,
which is installed with mineflayer automatically.
```js
require('minecraft-data')(bot.version)
```
If you need it independent of mineflayer,
instead of `bot.version` you can insert your own version from release 1.0.0 to 22w14a (latest 1.19 snapshot)
